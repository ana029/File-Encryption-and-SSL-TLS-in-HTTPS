RSA vs AES Comparison
---------------------------------------
RSA:
- Type: Asymmetric (uses Public & Private keys)
- Speed: Slower, computationally heavy
- Use-case: Secure key exchange, digital signatures, small data encryption
- Key size: Typically 2048 or 4096 bits
- Performance: Not suitable for large files

AES:
- Type: Symmetric (uses one shared key)
- Speed: Very fast and efficient for large data
- Use-case: File encryption, disk encryption, VPNs, etc.
- Key size: 128, 192, 256 bits
- Performance: Ideal for bulk encryption
