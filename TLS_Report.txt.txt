TLS Report

1. TLS Handshake Explanation:
The TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake is the process that establishes a secure, 
encrypted connection between a client (e.g., browser) and a server. It ensures authentication,
confidentiality, and integrity before any sensitive data is exchanged.
When a client connects to a secure website, it initiates a TLS handshake. 
During this process:
- The client sends "ClientHello" with supported TLS versions and cipher suites.
ClientHello:The client sends a message to the server that includes supported TLS versions, a list of cipher 
suites, and a random value.
- The server responds with "ServerHello", selecting the TLS version and cipher suite.
- The server sends its digital certificate for authentication.
Certificate Exchange:
The server sends its digital certificate (containing its public key) to prove its identity. The client 
verifies this certificate using trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- Both sides generate session keys using asymmetric cryptography (X25519).
Key Exchange:
Both sides generate and exchange cryptographic parameters to derive a shared session key, used for symmetric 
encryption during the session.
- After the handshake, all communication is encrypted with symmetric encryption (AES-256).
Finished Messages:
Both client and server send “Finished” messages encrypted with the new session key, confirming that the
 handshake was successful.After this point, all communication is encrypted.


2. MITM Protection Mechanisms:
TLS protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through:
- Digital certificates signed by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- Server authentication using digital signatures (ECDSA).
- Encrypted key exchange preventing attackers from reading or altering messages.
- Message authentication codes (MAC) ensuring data integrity.

3. TLS Application in Websites:
In HTTPS, TLS encrypts all data between client and server.
It ensures:
- Confidentiality: Data is encrypted with AES-256.
- Integrity: SHA-384 prevents tampering.
- Authentication: Certificates prove the website’s identity.
In this case, google.com uses TLS 1.3 with cipher suite TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.
